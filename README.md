TrulyErgonomicKeyboardLayout
============================

My personalized layout for the Truly Ergonomic Keyboard 
(https://www.trulyergonomic.com/).

Experimenting to get an efficient and ergonomic layout that
works well with programming, alt-tabbing and all the other things 
I do all day long at work and at home.

To use this, the keyboard has to be flashed with the hex file from
the official layout creator at the manufacturers site. The binaries
are contained here but can be downloaded from the trulyergonomic.com.

Either use the hexfile here or use the URL provided to access the
layout creator and generate the hexfile.

Have fun!
